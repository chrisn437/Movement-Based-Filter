# Movement-Based-Filter
I used the accelerometer and gyroscope to apply a filter on the camera feed. Therefore, I accessed the camera stream (so it also adapts to the screen size and rotation) and put a color filter in front of it based on the acceleration and rotation.
Acceleration is altering the opacities of the filter, and rotation of the smartphone is altering the colors.
